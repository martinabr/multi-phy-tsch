Examples for firefly:
* cc1200-demo: nullrdc with cc1200, useful to characterize links on a given channel (PRR and RSSI)
* dual-radio-demo: nullrdc with cc1200+cc2538, used to test the multiradio module
* rime-tsch: basic TSCH example using both the cc1200+cc2538 (EBs sent on the former, data on the latter)
* rpl-tsch: not really operational yet
